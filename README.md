# Research Code Snippets

Just a few bits of code from the last year. Of note: 

1. Monte Carlo codes to simulate molecular water inside a crystal. 
2. Script to quickly extract intial and final coordinates from SIESTA output files. 
3. Script to rotate molecules around arbritrary points. (Note to self, write a better one of these with quaternions.)
